              The 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1
              Rolex Sakhir Grand Prix 2020) is a Formula One motor race that is
              scheduled to take place over 87 laps on 6 December 2020 on the
              'Outer Circuit' configuration at the Bahrain International Circuit
              in Sakhir, Bahrain. This is the first Formula One race on the this
              track configuration. The race will be the sixteenth and
              penultimate round in the 2020 Formula One World Championship and
              the second of two back-to-back races in Bahrain to take place
              during the season with the Bahrain Grand Prix having taken place
              at the same venue the week before, but on a different layout. The
              race also marks the first running of the Sakhir Grand Prix.

              The Bahrain International Circuit is a motorsport venue opened in
              2004 and used for drag racing, GP2 Series and the annual Bahrain
              Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle
              East. Beginning in 2006, Australian V8 Supercars raced at the BIC,
              with the event known as the Desert 400. However, the V8 Supercars
              did not return for the 2011 V8 Supercar season. 24 Hour endurance
              races are also hosted at BIC. The circuit has a FIA Grade 1
              license.

              2020 Sakhir Grand Prix will use the 'Outer Circuit' layout, the
              first Formula One race to be held on this layout. At a length of
              3.543 km (2.202 mi) it is a shorter layout than the 5.412 km
              (3.363 mi) 'Grand Prix' layout, which aside from some minor tweaks
              to the exit of turn 4 ahead of 2005 event is otherwise the same
              circuit that has been used reguarly for Formula One races since
              the inaugural Bahrain Formula One race in 2004 except at the 2010
              Bahrain Grand Prix where a longer 6.299 km (3.914 mi) 'Endurance
              Circuit' configuration was used. As a result, the race is due to
              be contested over 87 laps to exceed the 305 km (190 mi) race
              distance mandated by the regulations. According to simulations lap
              times are expected to be under one minute. If achieved, this would
              only be the second Grand Prix weekend in history to see sub one
              minute lap times after the 1974 French Grand Prix at Dijon-Prenois
              where Niki Lauda set a pole position qualifying time of 58.79
              seconds in a Ferrari 312B3-74. Prior to the event many drivers
              suggested they were looking forward to the challenges of the Outer
              Circuit with McLaren driver Lando Norris likening the circuits
              high speed nature as similar to Thruxton Circuit in England,
              whilst Williams driver George Russell said the circuit was
              "definitely gonna be bonkers, for sure" when asked his opinion on
              the layout. Renault driver Daniel Ricciardo expressed his hope
              that the circuit would provide good overtaking opportunities, with
              Carlos Sainz Jr. of McLaren suggesting that choosing the correct
              setup – particularly downforce levels – would be difficult.

            <p className='mt-2 text-normal leading-normal text-gray-700'>
              The construction of the Bahrain circuit was a national objective
              for Bahrain, initiated by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin
              Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of
              the Bahrain Motor Federation. TRL was asked to build the circuit,
              headed by Patrick Brogan. Race organizers were worried that the
              circuit would not be complete in time for the 2004 Bahrain Grand
              Prix and attempted to cancel the event; however, Formula One
              supremo Bernie Ecclestone refused this request. In the end, the
              circuit was not quite fully complete, but was good enough for the
              grand prix to go ahead.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2 text-normal leading-normal text-gray-700'>
              After the 2004 race and ahead of the 2005 race the track was
              realigned at turn four, decreasing the circuit's overall length by
              5 metres. In 2007 the circuit became the first Grand Prix circuit
              to be awarded the distinguished FIA Institute Centre of Excellence
              award, given for excellent safety, race marshal, and medical
              facilities, and for the high standards of technology required to
              maintain these. At the 2009 Grand Prix, BIC announced a
              collaboration with @bahrain to develop land next to the circuit.
              @bahrain is part of the Mumtalakat group of companies. @bahrain
              will dedicate more than 1 million square meters of business,
              entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of
              US$2bn (BHD 850million), making it one of the largest investment
              projects to take place in Bahrain in the past five years.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2 text-normal leading-normal text-gray-700'>
              The circuit was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the
              same architect who designed the Sepang International Circuit in
              Malaysia. The main contractor for the project was Cebarco-WCT. The
              circuit cost approximately 56.2 million Bahraini Dinars (US$150
              million) to construct. It has six separate tracks, including a
              test oval and a drag strip. The circuit posed a unique problem.
              Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand
              would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However,
              organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an
              adhesive on the sand around the track.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2 text-normal leading-normal text-gray-700'>
              The surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped
              to Bahrain from Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England. The
              surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula
              1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers. The same aggregate
              material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit, venue of the Abu Dhabi
              Grand Prix.

              It was 2004 when the drivers first lined up under an unusually
              cloudy sky for the inaugural Bahrain Grand Prix. The race was
              dominated (like many in 2004) by the two Ferraris, with Michael
              Schumacher winning out from Rubens Barrichello, while the crowds
              were also treated to a fantastic dog-fight between the Jaguar of
              Mark Webber and the Renault of Fernando Alonso.

                A lap in a Formula One car -
              </span>{' '}
              The DRS zone is on the pit straight at the Bahrain Grand Prix
              (starting 2012), so turn 1 ("Michael Schumacher turn") is the
              prime overtaking opportunity. The corner itself is incredibly
              tight; a typical F1 car must brake approximately 100 metres before
              the corner and shift right down to gear one. The width of the
              track further adds to the overtaking possibilities.[14] Turns 2
              and 3 are flat out and gaining a good exit can set up an
              overtaking opportunity into turn 4. The straight leading to turn 4
              is very long with a DRS zone, and the track at the corner itself
              is incredibly wide, at about thirty metres.[14] Turns 5, 6 and 7
              make up a high-speed left-right-left "S" section that leads into
              turn 8, a right-hand hairpin where taking a wide line can avoid
              the bump on the apex which unsettles the car.[15] Turns 9 and 10
              are very challenging as they are two blind left-handers where cars
              must brake, downshift and turn simultaneously – they go from 205
              km/h in gear 5 down to 63 km/h in gear 1 whilst trying to avoid
              locking up their inside front tyres.[14] The back straight leads
              down into turns 11, 12 and 13, a medium-speed complex of corners.
              Turn 11 is a fourth-gear left hander that leads immediately into
              the flat-out right hander of 12, then the third gear right-hander
              of turn 13 which requires a good exit to gain speed down the
              following straight. It is worth braking quite early for turn 14 to
              gain speed down the main straight.[15] If you brake about 100
              metres before the apex then it is easy to keep it tidy through the
              slow right hander and you can also put the power down early, and
              gain speed all the way through turn 15 and the main straight
              (which is the DRS zone).
