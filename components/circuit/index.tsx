              Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken D’italia 2020 takes place over 53
              laps of the 5.793-kilometre Autodromo Nazionale Monza on Sunday,

              The Autodromo Nazionale di Monza is a historic race track near the
              city of Monza, north of Milan, in Italy. Built in 1922, it is the
              world's third purpose-built motor racing circuit after those of
              Brooklands and Indianapolis. The circuit's biggest event is the
              Formula One Italian Grand Prix. Except for in 1980, the race has
              been hosted there since the series' inception.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2 text-normal leading-normal text-gray-700'>
              Built in the Royal Villa of Monza park in a woodland setting, the
              site has three tracks – the 5.793-kilometre (3.600 mi) Grand Prix
              track, the 2.405-kilometre (1.494 mi) Junior track, and a
              4.250-kilometre (2.641 mi) high speed oval track with steep
              bankings which has been unused for many decades and has been
              decaying for years until restorations in the 2010s. The major
              features of the main Grand Prix track include the Curva Grande,
              the Curva di Lesmo, the Variante Ascari and the Curva Parabolica.
              The high speed curve, Curva Grande, is located after the Variante
              del Rettifilo which is located at the end of the front straight or
              Rettifilo Tribune, and is usually taken flat out by Formula One
              cars.

              Constructed in just 110 days in 1922, the Autodromo Nazionale
              Monza was the world’s third purpose-built race track, coming after
              Brooklands in the UK and Indianapolis in the US. Like those two
              tracks, the original circuit featured a daunting series of banked
              curves, as well as much of the ‘outfield’ section that’s still in
              use today. Monza opened its doors on September 3 1922, just a week
              before it hosted that year’s Italian Grand Prix. It was then part
              of the original Formula 1 calendar in 1950, and has held the
              Italian Grand Prix every year bar one since.

              The parkland setting of Monza, located just to the north east of
              Italy’s fashion capital Milan, makes for a relaxed, leafy setting
              for a Grand Prix, while the preserved Monza banking – spot it in
              the background as the cars exit the Parabolica, as well as on the
              flyover bridge they pass under en route to the Variante Ascari –
              leaves you in no doubt that you’re in the presence of a very
              special race track.

              Drivers are on full throttle for most of the lap due to its long
              straights and fast corners, and is usually the scenario in which
              the open-wheeled Formula One cars show the raw speed of which they
              are capable: 372 kilometres per hour (231 mph) during the
              mid-2000s V10 engine formula, although in 2012 with the 2.4L V8
              engines, top speeds in Formula One rarely reached over 340
              kilometres per hour (211 mph); the 1.6L turbocharged hybrid V6
              engine, reduced-downforce formula of 2014 displayed top speeds of
              up to 360 kilometres per hour (224 mph). The circuit is generally
              flat, but has a gradual gradient from the second Lesmos to the
              Variante Ascari. Due to the low aerodynamic profile needed, with
              its resulting low downforce, the grip is very low; understeer is a
              more serious issue than at other circuits; however, the opposite
              effect, oversteer, is also present in the second sector, requiring
              the use of a very distinctive opposite lock technique. Since both
              maximum power and minimal drag are keys for speed on the
              straights, only competitors with enough power or aerodynamic
              efficiency at their disposal are able to challenge for the top
              places.

              In addition to Formula One, the circuit previously hosted the 1000
              km Monza, and endurance sports car race held as part of the World
              Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans Series. Monza also featured
              the unique Race of Two Worlds events, which attempted to run
              Formula One and USAC National Championship cars against each
              other. The racetrack also previously held rounds of the Grand Prix
              motorcycle racing (Italian motorcycle Grand Prix), World Touring
              Car Championship, TCR International Series, Superbike World
              Championship, Formula Renault 3.5 Series and Auto GP. Monza
              currently hosts rounds of the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup,
              International GT Open and Euroformula Open Championship, as well
              as various local championships such as the TCR Italian Series,
              Italian GT Championship, Porsche Carrera Cup Italia and Italian F4
              Championship, as well as the Monza Rally Show.

                A lap in a Formula One car
              </span>{' '}
              would be as follows - Cars approach the first corner at 340
              kilometres per hour (210 mph) in eighth gear, and brake at about
              120 metres (390 ft) before the first chicane – the Variante del
              Rettifilo – entering at 86 km/h (53 mph) in first gear, and
              exiting at 74 kilometres per hour (46 mph) in second gear. Good
              traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap.
              Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible
              by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can
              result in a lot of time being lost through the Curva Grande down
              to the Variante della Roggia chicane in seventh gear, at 330
              kilometres per hour (210 mph). The braking point is just under the
              bridge. The kerbs are very vicious and it is very easy for a car
              to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control. This chicane is
              probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only
              one with the "slow corner, long straight, slow corner"; one of the
              characteristics of modern circuits. The Curve di Lesmo are two
              corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still
              challenging corners. The first is blind, entered at 264 km/h (164
              mph) in fifth gear, dropping to fourth gear at 193 km/h (120 mph),
              and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at 260
              km/h (160 mph), apexing in third gear at 178 kilometres per hour
              (111 mph), and it is very important that all the kerb is used. A
              mistake at one of these corners will result in a spin into the
              gravel, while good exits can set you up for an overtaking move
              into Variante Ascari. The downhill straight down to Variante
              Ascari is very bumpy under the bridge. Variante Ascari is a very
              tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time. The final
              challenge is the Curva Parabolica: approaching at 335 kilometres
              per hour (208 mph) in seventh gear, cars quickly dance around the
              corner, apexing in fourth gear at 215 kilometres per hour (134
              mph) and exiting in fifth gear at 285 kilometres per hour (177
              mph), accelerating onto the main start/finish straight. A good
              exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight
              can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into
              Variante del Rettifilo; however, it is difficult to follow a
              leading car closely through the Parabolica as the tow will reduce
              downforce and cornering speed. Maximum speed achieved in a 2019
              Formula One car is 359.7 km/h (223.5 mph), established at the end
              of the start/finish straight. They experience a maximum g-force of
              4.50 during deceleration, as the track has many dramatic high to
              low speed transitions. Cars are on full throttle for 80% of the
              lap, and hit their Vmax on the circuit’s 1.1km start/finish
              straight.
