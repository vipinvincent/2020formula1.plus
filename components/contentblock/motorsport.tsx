            Ricciardo's engine undamaged after FP2 stoppage

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Renault F1 boss Cyril Abiteboul says Daniel Ricciardo's engine and
            gearbox are unharmed after a hydraulic failure stopped the
            Australian's car on track in second practice for the Belgian GP.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Ricciardo stopped on track with some 15 minutes left on the clock
            and marshals had to push his car behind the barriers. Prior to the
            issue, Ricciardo set what would stand as the second fastest time in
            the session, behind only Red Bull's Max Verstappen. He also logged
            the best sector time in S3, while his team mate Esteban Ocon was
            fastest in S1. Abiteboul cautioned that it's still early in the
            Belgian GP weekend, but he conceded that it was a promising start
            for the Enstone outfit
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            "What happens on Friday isn't always representative of Saturday and
            Sunday, and it's Sunday that matters," Abiteboul told Sky F1. "We
            see that the car has made some progress, except for Barcelona, where
            we were not quite able to get the set-up, but also in terms of
            overall aerodynamic performance competitiveness. At a low downforce
            track, a bit like Silverstone, but even a different extreme here, we
            feel good. "We feel that the engine is working well. Obviously there
            is the disappointment of the run that was cut short because of the
            hydraulic problem, but as far as I understand no damage to the
            gearbox, which was new, or to the engine, which is what matters.
            "The car was going to stop anyway when you lose hydraulic pressure,
            but we understand no damage was done to the engine." Abiteboul
            conceded that the cars were running a low-downforce levels â€“ a
            policy that might be compromised because of the threat of rain later
            in the weekend.
