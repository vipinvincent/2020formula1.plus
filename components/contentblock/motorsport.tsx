            Horner: F1 not seeing the "real" Vettel in 2020
          </ActionLink>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner has defended his former driver
            Sebastian Vettel after the German's difficult start to the 2020
            Formula 1 season.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Horner said F1 is not seeing the “real Sebastian Vettel” at the
            moment, suggesting that he is struggling in his current environment.
            Vettel won four world championships with Red Bull in 2010-13 before
            joining Ferrari in 2015. Since then he has won 14 races with the
            Italian team, and was runner-up in the championship in both 2017 and
            2018. However, he has not be retained for 2021, and thus far this
            season he has struggled to match teammate Charles Leclerc, scoring
            16 points to Leclerc's 45.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Horner was asked by Motorsport.com if Vettel was struggling now in
            part because cars have changed since he excelled in the days of
            blown diffusers. “Well, not really,” said Horner. “I mean, Sebastian
            drove with refuelling, no refuelling, blown diffusers, no diffusers,
            f-ducts, no f-ducts, DRS, no DRS. He drove a whole variance of
            different cars over the years. “And obviously what he achieved in
            the period during those years with Red Bull was quite special. I
            think he's the third most successful driver in the history of the
            sport.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            “And he has achieved some incredible things, many records which will
            stand for some time. So, for whatever reason, things aren’t working
            for him at the moment. I think any driver has to be happy in their
            environment, and you can see that he's carrying quite a lot of
            weight on his shoulders. “And that has a bearing on any on any
            sportsman, on any athlete. So I don't think we're seeing the real
            Sebastian Vettel at the moment.
