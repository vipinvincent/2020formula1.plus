            Hamilton grabs Portuguese GP pole from Bottas on Medium sets with
            Verstappen in third
          </H1>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Lewis Hamilton delivered his best lap when it matters and grabs
            last-gasp Portuguese GP pole. Valtteri Bottas on a different
            strategy could not match his Mercedes team mate in qualifying pace.
            Mercedes opted for a unique strategy for the final runs, swapping
            the so called faster Red walled softs to the Yellow walled medium
            tyres on both cars. However, Hamilton opted to head out early for
            two flying laps on that compound, while Bottas went for one. For a
            short instant it seems like the Finn will beat Hamilton with his
            lap, but the defending world champion made it count to take his 97th
            career pole position, pushing Bottas to second spot, in an
            all-Mercedes front row. Max Verstappen took third on the usual soft
            tyres, as Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finished an impressive fourth. A
            splendid performance from Racing Point’s Sergio Perez helped him to
            finish fifth.

            Alex Albon in the second Red Bull finished sixth which was half a
            second slower than his team mate Verstappen, while Carlos Sainz
            became the leader driver for McLaren as Lando Norris finished eight
            which was only just 0.005s slower than his team mate. Pierre Gasly
            could not keep up his impressive Q1 and Q2 performances and ended up
            in ninth. Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo completed the top 10 list,
            albeit without setting a timed lap as he ran off the track at the
            end of Q2 damaging his rear end of R.S.2.0. His teammate Esteban
            Ocon finished 11th as Lance Stroll, who got recovered from COVID 19
            in the second Racing Point only managed P12. Daniil Kvyat in the
            second AlphaTauri finished P13.

            Mr. Saturday, George Russel of Williams, impressed gain with his Q1
            performance and finished P14 ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel who
            once again failed to get into Q3 as his time got deleted for
            exceeding track limits on his last run. Both Alfa Romeo’s followed
            their engine supplier with Kimi Räikkönen once gain finished ahead
            of his teammate Antonio Giovinazzi. The Haas of Romain Grosjean and
            Kevin Magnussen crossed the line in P17 and P18 respectively with
            Nicholas Latifi in the second Williams completes the list. The
            conditions in Portugal looks perfect for Mercedes as they could wrap
            up the constructors title if they finish first and second in this
            round.
