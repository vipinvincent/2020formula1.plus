            Does Perez’s future lie with Alfa Romeo amid Vettel links to Racing
            Point?

            Sergio Perez is no stranger to silly season – the Mexican is now
            competing in his 10th Formula 1 campaign having typically signed
            one-year deals throughout his career. This season should have been
            different, though, as last summer, Perez signed a huge three-year
            extension to race for Racing Point until the end of 2022.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-1 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Complete that deal and he will have spent an incredible nine years
            with the Silverstone-based outfit. But the availability of a certain
            four-time world champion, in the form of Sebastian Vettel, and new
            lofty ambitions for his team as they prepare to rebrand as Aston
            Martin Racing in 2021, and suddenly, his future isn’t so concrete.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-1 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            This year’s Hungarian Grand Prix weekend was not ideal for Perez.
            Two years after it emerged at the same venue that Perez had put the
            team, then known as Force India, into administration to save them,
            the Mexican was first bombarded with questions about his future –
            and then he felt unwell, to the point of feeling dizzy when driving
            and suffering neck pain.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-1 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            The party line is that both Perez and Lance Stroll both have
            contracts for 2021. But my sources say Vettel has been offered a
            deal that would bring him onboard next season, with the German left
            to take his time to mull that over. Three, naturally, doesn't go
            into two.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-1 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            With Stroll’s father Lawrence owning the team, Perez was the one
            many felt would be out on his ear, despite his impressive loyalty to
            the team and the fact he’s the more experienced and - as the stats
            show - more successful of the two. Even though it’s unclear who
            would go should Vettel join, Perez has unsurpringly already received
            a plethora of interest from teams in other motorsport series, as
            well as from one F1 outfit, showing just how highly-rated he is.
