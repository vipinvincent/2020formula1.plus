            Verstappen leads the final practice session ahead of Bottas and

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Red Bull’s Max Verstappen set the fastest lap of FP3 in Sakhir, and
            denied Mercedes a clean sweep. Incidentally, the time set by Max in
            FP3 became the fastest time was 54.064s of the weekend so far which
            glimpses the close race that we could expect for the weekend.
            Merecdes’ manages P2 and AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly impressed with a
            P3 performance in the race like conditions under lights. Bottas was
            0.206s behind the leader on this short track, whereas Gasly was
            0.363s off top spot. FP1 and FP2 leader George Russell could only
            manage seventh, locking up heavily on a late soft-tyred run. Another
            person who impressed in FP3 was Renault’s Esteban Ocon with a P4
            finish in FP3 , just 0.026s behind Gasly. McLaren’s Lando Norris
            rounding out the top five list, half a second adrift from the
            leader.

            Alex Albon in the second Red Bull only managed P6 which was half a
            second off his team mate at the top. Behind Russel, both Racing
            Points finished in top 10 with Sergio Perez leading Lance Stroll in
            P8 and P9 respectively. Carlos Sainz in the second McLaren finished
            in P10 which was by just over a tenth second from his the teammate
            Norris. Antonio Giovinazzi in Alfa Romeo managed a P11 finish ahead
            of Daniil Kvyat in the second AlphaTauri. Ferrari finished 13th and
            15th, with Charles Leclerc ahead of Sebastian Vettel. The two were
            split by 0.004s as they appear to be neck-and-neck ahead of
            qualifying. Leclerc spun on his final lap of the session, ruining
            hopes of an improvement from P13. Unfortunately, Vettel’s session
            ended early as he encountered a power unit failure with around 15
            minutes left. His engineers are now left with the task of changing
            his engine, as a precaution, before qualifying.

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Between the Ferraris Daniel Ricciardo finished in P14 as he had a
            scary moment on a late run at sector 2 and might have damaged his
            floor, as he went over the kerbs. Alfa Romeo's veteran Kimi
            Raikkonen could only finish 16th, while Haas’ Kevin Magnussen
            finished 17th. Williams finished 18th and 20th with Nicholas Latifi
            ahead of Jack Aitken, who is in for George Russell this weekend.
            Haas’ Pietro Fittipaldi standing in for the injured Romain Grosjean
            ended up 19th, but will start his race in the back as the Haas
            debutant, this weekend, will be hit with a grid penalty as he’s
            taken new control electronics and energy store this weekend
            exceeding his car's allocation. Notably, in the FP3 the whole field
            split by just 1.606s which shows how short and pacey the track will
            be for the Sunday race.
