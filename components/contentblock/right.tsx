          <H1>Bottas leads in FP1 from Verstappen and Leclerc at Mugello</H1>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Valtteri Bottas continues his top form in Friday with fifth
            consecutive top position in FP1 session at Mugello for Mercedes. In
            the first ever FP1 session at Mugello Red Bull’s Max Verstappen
            finished second and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in third, as Scuderia
            Ferrari celebrates their 1000th World Championship race in this
            weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix. All the top drivers set their fast time
            on soft tyres and it was Bottas who was the first person to cut the
            1m 17m barrier, set his fastest time of 1m17.879s which was just
            0.048s quicker than Verstappen’s. Meanwhile retro-liveried Ferrari
            of Leclerc, managed to lap faster than Lewis Hamilton who finished
            fourth, managed to take third spot in an encouraging session for the
            Italian team ahead of their anniversary race. Leclerc finished
            0.307s off Bottas’s table-topping time and Hamilton was half a
            second behind his team mate. Last week’s Italian Grand Prix winner
            AlphaTauri ‘s Pierre Gasly took fifth who was 0.797s off the top
            rounded top5 list.

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Esteban Ocon for Renault finished sixth with the second AlphaTauri
            of Daniil Kvyat was Seventh who was the last driver within a second
            of Bottas. Best of McLaren was Lando Norris, finished Eighth, just
            under a tenth ahead of Red Bull’s Alex Albon. Daniel Ricciardo
            rounded out the top 10 in his Renault. Kimi Raikkonen, who is
            celebrating the 20th anniversary of his maiden F1 test at this very
            track, finished in 11th who was in third position for a brief
            moment, fastest of all the Ferrari-powered cars. Romain Grosjean for
            Haas finished in 12th and Sebastian Vettel of the second Ferrari
            crossed the line in 13th with more than 1.3s slower than his team
            mate.

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Last week’s podium finisher Carlos Sainz was 15th for McLaren as
            Sainz’s MCL35 was testing a new design with a new nose in FP1.
            Williams’ George Russell finished in P16 as he was the only driver
            to set his fastest lap on medium tyres. Kevin Magnussen in the
            second Haas , who has a new engine for the weekend crossed the line
            in P17. The Racing Point pair of Lance Stroll and outgoing Sergio
            Perez were P18 and P19 respectively, as their fastest laps were set
            on hard tyres, concentrating on race like simulation in FP1.
            Williams’ Latifi had a late spin and was the only yellow flag in the
            session, finished last.
