            Lewis Hamilton tops the final practice and looks well set for
            qualifying as his teammate Valtteri Bottas only could manage a P2
            0.776s slower after topped both practice sessions on Friday for
            Mercedes. McLaren’s Carlos Sainz impressed with a late flyer,
            finished third 0.817s off the lead time narrowly behind Bottas and
            more than a tenth ahead of Renault’s Esteban Ocon. Racing Point’s
            Sergio Perez within a second of Hamilton rounded off top 5. Max
            Verstappen for Red Bull only could manage P6 after spending most of
            the session on soft tyres had to slow down by traffic on his last
            flying lap. Sebastian Vettel ended seventh for Ferrari with a
            brilliant flying effort, but damaged his floor going wide on the
            last corner.

            Lance Stroll in the second Racing Point finished P8 just behind
            Vettel after a difficult FP2 on Friday afternoon. Daniil Kvyat
            impressed for Alpha Tauri as he finished ahead of his teammate in P9
            which is 1.5s slower than the lead driver. Renault's Daniel
            Ricciardo, only manage Tenth as he was slowed by a problem with his
            right wing mirror. Pierre Gasly in second Alpha Tauri finished P11,
            only after spinning early on and then encountering traffic late in
            the session. Charles Leclerc managed P12, as he couldn’t match his
            Ferrari team mate Vettel.

            George Russell of Williams finished in P13 ahead of Romain Grosjean
            in Haas who had a late spin at Turn 15, but ended the session a
            solid 14th for Haas despite repeated radio calls to him engineer
            complaining of problems with the car. His team mate Kevin Magnussen
            took 16th with Williams’ Nicholas Latifi between them on the board.
            The Alfa Romeo pair followed Magnussen on the timesheets with
            Antonio Giovinazzi leading his teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Alex Albon
            had his fastest time deleted for overstepping track limits, leaving
            him down in 19th, ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris who was unable to
            get a clean lap in through the session. Since the Practice sessions
            are wrapped up, now all eyes will be in Qualifying to know the pole
            sitter, who subsequently have won every Russian Grand Prix since the
            race’s inauguration in 2014.
