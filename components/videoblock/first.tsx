            Renault have decided to call off the dogs in their pursuit of a
            larger punishment for Racing Point. The pink team were stripped of
            fifteen points and fined 400,000 euro for the Styrian Grand Prix,
            and reprimanded for every other race theyâ€™ve entered since. This was
            after an FIA investigation into their brake ducts adjudged them to
            have been designed by Mercedes in 2019, with Racing Point using the
            parts throughout 2019 and into 2020. This was legal in 2019, but not
            in 2020, leading to a complicated mess where the parts in question
            are legal from a technical perspective, but not from a sporting
            perspective.
