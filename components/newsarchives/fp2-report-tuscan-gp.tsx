            Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas leads FP2 with his teammate Lewis Hamilton
            in second and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third. Bottas better his
            time from FP1 as he crossed the line in 1m16.989s becoming the only
            driver to break the 1m 16second barrier nearly a second faster than
            his session-leading time from this morning. Hamilton finished
            +0.207s off Bottas’ pace with Max Verstappen 0.039s further back.
            Alex Albon finished fourth which was over seven-tenths off Max’s
            time. Behind the pairs of Mercedes and Red Bull, both Renaults
            slotted into P5 and with Daniel Ricciardo narrowly ahead of Esteban
            Ocon which was over a second slower than the lead driver Bottas.

            Sergio Perez of Racing Point finished in seventh, ahead of Monza
            winner Pierre Gasly in eighth for AlphaTauri. Kimi Raikkonen
            impressed with ninth spot for Alfa Romeo, as he become the best of
            the Ferrari powered cars. Meanwhile, there was a bizarre incident
            involving Raikkonen and Perez happened as the two drivers collided
            at Turn 1 just as Perez was leaving the pit lane, bringing out the
            red flag for cleaning the debris. The incident was later set to be
            investigated after the session. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari only
            could manage tenth place with 1.4 seconds behind the leader. Lance
            Stroll in second Racing Point finished P11 with the second Ferrari
            of Sebastian Vettel in P12. Both Ferrari drivers suffered spins at
            the Correntaio corner during the session with Vettel's power unit
            cut out at the end of the session, and he had to park his car on the
            track.

            McLaren drivers couldn’t impress as they could only finish P13 and
            P14 with Carlos Sainz leading Lando Norris. Norris had a hairy
            moment during mid-session who ran off the track at the exit of Turn
            3, only to spin into the wall and crashing the front wing off his
            MCL35, bringing out the red flags and session stops for 10 minutes.
            Daniil Kvyat fininsed in 15th in the second AlphaTauri, while George
            Russell finised 16th for Williams. The second Alfa Romeo of Antonio
            Giovinazzi slotted into 17th spot as the second Williams of Nicholas
            Latifi finised in 18th. The two Haas cars of Kevin Magnussen and
            Romain Grosjean rooted to the last spots as Grosjean missed much of
            the session with an electrical issue.
