            with an impressive third in FP2, which was 1.058s off Bottas, but a
            tenth and a half up on his next closest competitor, McLaren’s Carlos
            Sainz who crashed into the barriers in FP1, His team mate Lando
            Norris in P5 rounded of top 5. Sergio Perez finished sixth in the
            old spec Racing Point RP20. Max Verstappen had disappointing session
            as he clunked the kerb at the exit of Turn 2 on his fastest lap and
            run wide, leaving him P7, and 1.529s off the lead time.
