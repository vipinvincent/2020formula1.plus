            Verstappen, while championship leader Hamilton finished the session
            in P19

            Friday practice champion, Valtteri Bottas continues his Friday
            brilliance with sixith top position in FP1 session at Sochi for
            Mercedes. half a second faster than runner-up Renault’s Daniel
            Ricciardo finised second with half a second slower than the leader
            and 0.6s quicker than third-place Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. The
            Racing Points were just behind the Red Bull with Sergio Perez in P4
            and Lance Stroll P5. The Racing Points once again spotted running
            two different spec cars in the weekend as in Mugello as they have
            delayed updates for Perez’s car as Stroll's crash in the last Grand
            Prix have delayed Racing Point's development, meaning only the
            Canadian has the new parts this weekend.

            Renault's Esteban Ocon finished in Sixth, with home racer Daniil
            Kvyat taking P7 for AlphaTauri. Kvyat was the fastest driver of the
            session on medium tyres, as all of the top six have set their
            fastest laps on softs. Alex Albon on soft tyres finished Eighth for
            Red Bull, just ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in P9 and over
            three-tenths faster than medium-shod AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly,
            who rounded-out the top 10. Charles in second Ferrari finished P11
            with 2 second slower than the leader.

            The session was interrupted twice by two crashes. The first was by
            Carlos Sainz as he spun backwards into the Turn 7 barriers, leaving
            his McLaren's rear wing hanging off precariously. He finished 12th
            quickest in the session with his teammate Lando Norris in P13.
            Thirty minutes later, Nicholas Latifi went similarly sideways into
            the Turn 10 barriers and his Williams' rear wing suffered the same
            fate as Sainz's. This time, a red flag was brought out while the car
            was recovered. Alfa Romeo duo, led by Antonio Giovinazzi (P14) over
            Kimi Raikkonen (P15), who is on the verge of becoming the joint-most
            experienced F1 driver, along with Rubens Barrichello, this weekend
            with his 322nd start. Kevin Magnussen finished P16 with Latifi's
            team mate George Russell finished 17th. Romain Grosjean, who
            struggled with his car's balance and spun at Turn 13 with a
            tailwind, finished 17th as championship leader Lewis Hamilton
            finished the session down in P19. Hamilton's session was compromised
            by early lock-ups both on the softs and the hards, which
            flat-spotted his rubber and ruined his chances of setting any quick
            lap times – as evidenced by his fastest being 2.793s slower than his
            team mate's.
