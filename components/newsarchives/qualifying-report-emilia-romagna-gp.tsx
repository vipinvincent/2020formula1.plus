            of 0.097s just managed to out class his team mate and rival Lewis
            Hamilton in his final run in qualifying. Max Verstappen, after
            surviving Q2 scare took 3rd which was incidentally more than half a
            second behind the silver cars. Red Bull mechanics once again rose to
            the occasion, as they turn around an improbable solution after
            encountering a power unit/spark plug issue in Q2 within few minutes.
            The home runners Alfa Tauri impressed the most with both cars in Q3.
            Pierre Gasly, who was in scintillating form finished fourth to equal
            his career best start ahead of Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo in fifth.
