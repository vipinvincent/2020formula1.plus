            Mercedes claims their record seventh consecutive constructors’ title
            at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, as Lewis Hamilton wins in Imola
            with his team mate Valtteri Bottas finishing second ensuring
            Mercedes 1-2 on the historic day for F1. Meanwhile Renault’s Daniel
            Ricciardo secured the second podium of the season for Renault as Red
            Bull’s Max Verstappen retired from P2 after a tyre issue on lap 51.
            AlphaTauri’s Daniil Kvyat, who is yet to confirm a seat in 2020
            surprises every one with a brilliant fourth with Ferrari’s Charles
            Leclerc in fifth. Along with a better team strategy and a brilliant
            drive helped Charles to hold off the Racing Point of Sergio Perez,
            who missed the trick with a late stop under the Safety Car.

            The McLaren and Alfa Romeo duos rounded of the top ten list with
            Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris claimed P7 and P8, Kimi Raikkonen
            leading Antonio Giovinazzi in P9 and P10. Aided by a brilliant
            strategy with an extended 49-lap stint medium tyre management from
            Kimi helped Alfa Romeo took their first double points finish of the
            year. Nicholas Latifi finished eleventh agonisingly close to points
            for Williams. Struggling Sebastian Vettel, thanks to a horrible pit
            stop by Ferrari spoiled the race for him and only could manage a
            disappointing twelfth. Lance Stroll, after the first lap tangle and
            a broken front wing managed thirteenth spot in the list.

            Romain Grosjean for Hass crossed the line in fourteenth while his
            team mate, Kevin Magnussen had to retire the race in lap 50 after a
            terrible head ache. Alexander Albon disappoints again for Red Bull
            after a silly driver error forced the Thai driver to spin towards
            the last stint on the race became the last person of the finished
            drivers. An unusual mistake from George Russell, forced him spinning
            and ending up on the barriers as he tries to warm his tyres during
            the safety car. Esteban Ocon in the second Renault forced to park
            his car on the green in lap 29 with a a suspected gearbox issue.
            Meanwhile, after a brilliant qualification on Saturday, AlphaTauri’s
            Pierre Gasly suffered a coolant leak that forced him to retire from
            the race on Lap 8. With Mercedes wrapping up the constructors’ title
            of 2020 it is now matter of time to decide on the drivers’
            championship as it is looks like another Mercedes driver to crown
            the champion in 2020.
