            Stroll takes an exhilarating maiden pole in a chaotic wet qualifying
            at the Intercity Istanbul Park for Turkey GP. Racing Point's
            jubilation got doubled as Sergio Perez finished third as it was
            their their first-ever pole under this banner, just four races
            before they become Aston Martin, and their first since Giancarlo
            Fisichella took P1 at the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix when the team was
            racing as Force India. But a disappointed Max Verstappen manged
            front grid position as he clean swept all the practice sessions with
            P1 and looked good for his third P1 spot. But it was Sergio Perez
            who set the time sheets on fire with a blistering lap on the
            intermediate tyres, while all others were battling on wets to set a
            time. Inspired by the pace of Perez, the rest of grid start opting
            for intermediates; but none except Red Bulls could manage a better
            time as Albon goes fourth.

            Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo slotted into fifth for the second
            consecutive race on wets, ahead of championship leader Lewis
            Hamilton. Daniel’s teammate Esteban Ocon managed seventh on wets as
            Renault dint opt for the gambling on intermediates. The next big
            surprise was from Alfa Romeo, as the team managed to slot bot their
            cars in Q3 with Kimi Raikkonen in P8 with team mate Antonio
            Giovinazzi 10th marking Alfa Romeo’s best qualifying performance
            since Brazil 2019, on the occasion of Sauber’s 500th Grand Prix. The
            second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas only managed P9, as Mercedes
            seems to be struggling throughout in the wet conditions.

            Both the McLarens of Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz couldn’t promote
            themselves to Q3 as they finished in P11 and P13 sandwiching
            Sebastian Vettel in P12. His Ferrai team mate Charles Leclerc, who
            had blistering practice session couldn’t replicate the performace in
            the wets and ended up in P14. The AlphaTauri’s of Pierre Gasly and
            Daniil Kvyat also struggled in damp conditions as they only managed
            P15 and P17 respectively. Kevin Magnussen in Haas, who had issues
            with mist in helmet only managed P16 as his team mate Romain
            Grosjean in P19. The Williams duo of George Russell and Nicholas
            Latifi classified P18 and P20 as Russell will be required to start
            his race from the back for using additional power unit elements.
