            Hamilton grabs pole in Tuscan GP, as Bottas has to abort his fast
            lap run due to yellow flags

            Mercedes Lewis Hamilton beats his team mate Valtteri Bottas with a
            lap record time of 1:15.144 to snatch the pole position for the
            inaugural Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello. Meanwhile Bottas had to
            abort his last flying lap due to yellow flags prohibiting a clean
            sweep of the weekend runs. Bottas was +0.059s off Lewis’ pace but
            three tenths ahead of third place Max Verstappen of Red Bull. Max
            Verstappen was nearly 0.5s clear of his Red Bull team mate Alex
            Albon who finished fourth. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc got lucky ahead
            of Ferrari’s 1000 GP, as he was able to cross the line before the
            yellow flags came out, and finished fifth on the grid. The Racing
            Point duo of Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll finished P6 and P7
            respectively, despite the fact that Perez is running the old spec
            car compared to Stroll’s new updated package which includes a slick
            new sidepod arrangement and new brake ducts. However, Perez will
            start in P7 as he has to serve a grid place penalty for his
            collision with Kimi Raikkonen in practice session.

            Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo went eighth quickest, ahead of McLaren’s
            Carlos Sainz and teammate Esteban Ocon in P10 rounding out the top
            10. But Ocon couldn’t set a time in Q3 as he got it all wrong on his
            flying lap, spinning and bringing out the yellow flags. Lando Norris
            in second McLaren misses out Q3 and finished P11 ahead of
            AlphaTauri’s Daniil Kvyat. Kimi Räikkönen in Alfa Romeo once again
            out performed his old team mate in Ferrari Sebastian Vettel,
            finishing P13 and Vettel in P14. Romain Grosjean of Haas also
            couldn’t continue his impressive practice runs, only managed a
            non-impressive P15.

            Perhaps the most surprising news from Mugello was, the Italian Grand
            Prix race winner Pierre Gasly suffered a shock Q1 exit. He misses
            out Q2 by five hundredth of a second and finished P16. Antonio
            Giovinazzi finised in P17 ahead of both Williams of George Russell
            in P18 and Nicholas Latifi in P19. Kevin Magnussen of Hass finished
            in the last spot for the inaugural Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello.
