            Russian GP winner Valtteri Bottas beats Hamilton to Eifel GP pole as
            Mercedes continued their 100% pole position record for 2020 at the
            Eifel Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton finished P2 which is 0.256s behind
            his team mate, while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen secured P3 slot on
            the grid, but just 0.037s off Hamilton. Though Max was in
            provisional pole before the last stint of Q3, he couldn’t match the
            pace of Mercedes as he couldn’t find the sweat spot of grip in his
            last run. The breaking news of Nico Hulkenberg replacing sick Lance
            Stroll just came few minutes before the Qualifying, as the German
            was been in town for broadcast work before getting the call up to
            drive ahead of the session.

            Probably the second big surprise in Qualifying was from Ferrari, as
            Charles Leclerc splits the two Red Bull cars and finished P4. The
            performance upgrades to the floor and bargeboards of SF1000 seems to
            be working for Charles as his team Mate Sebastian Vettel narrowly
            misses Q3 and could only manage P11. The second Red Bull of Alex
            Albon finished in P5, ahead of tho reanults of Daniel Ricciardo and
            Esteban Ocon. McLarens of Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz finishes in
            eighth and 10th, sandwiching Sergio Perez in the updated RP20 in P9.

            The Alpha Tauris of Pierre Gasly and Daniil Kvyat also misses out Q2
            and could only manage P12 and P13 respectively. Antonio Giovinazzi
            out classed his team mate for the first time in 2020, as he
            participated in his maiden Q2 in this season, crossed the line in
            P14. Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in Haas follows the Alfa
            Romeo in P15 and P16 respectively as George Russell in Williams only
            could manage P17. Nicholas Latifi in the second Williams finishes in
            P18 ahead of Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Räikkönen in P19.

            But it was a mega effort from Hulkenberg who has been in the car for
            just 10 minutes managed a time of 1:28.021 which was only 0.4
            seconds slower than the Q2 time and only 0.2 seconds from his near
            rival. Later Hulkenberg revealed that “It was even wilder and
            crazier than last time,” “I was in Cologne which is an hour from
            here. I was due to come here this afternoon anyway, I was going to
            do some TV stuff from RTL tomorrow. I was sat with a friend having a
            coffee at 11am when I see that Otmar [Racing Point Team Principal]
            rings me and says ‘Hulkenberg, hurry we need you here’. he said.
