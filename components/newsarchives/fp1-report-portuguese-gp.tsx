            Friday King Valtteri Bottas became the fastest driver in FP1 at
            Portimao circuit in the first Portuguese Grand Prix weekend since
            1996. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton comes home in P2 as Red
            Bull’s Max Verstappen crossed the line P3. Most drivers opted for
            the hardest component tyres in the first practice session on the
            resurfaced Portimao circuit. Towards the end of the session both
            Mercedes drivers fitted with Yellow Medium tyres traded the places
            on the top of the grid, eventually Bottas pipped Hamilton at the
            chequered flag. Meanwhile Verstappen stuck with white Hard component
            tyres, concentrated mostly in long runs. Charles Leclerc in the
            updated Ferrari SF1000 crossed the line in P4 ahead of Alex Albon in
            the second Red Bull.

            McLaren's Carlos Sainz who completed most laps on Friday morning,
            finished in sixth ahead of Sergio Perez, who took P7 for Racing
            Point. Veteran Kimi Raikkonen crossed the line in P8 in the dying
            moments for Alfa Romeo as Renault's Daniel Ricciardo finished P9.
            Pierre Gasly had a mechanical problem towards late in the session on
            his AlphaTauri yet managed a stellar P10, ahead of Vettel in second
            Ferrari in P11.

            McLaren's Lando Norris finished in P12 just behind Vettel while
            Daniil Kvyat had a spun towards the end of the session and finished
            13th for AlphaTauri. Kevin Magnussen in Haas finished in P14 ahead
            of 15th place Lance Stroll, who looks recovered from the effects of
            Covid-19. Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi crossed the line in P16 as
            Romain Grojsean took P17 in second Haas. Williams drivers George
            Russell finised in 18th and Nicholas Latifi in 20th splitted by
            Renault's Ocon. Esteban Ocon’s session ended with a worrying
            mechanical issue, when smoke was seen coming from the back of his
            car just as the chequered flag was flying.

            Even though there was some spots of rain and the sky was dark during
            the session, the second practice session is predicted to be a clear
            sky session. The first 30 minutes of Free Practice 2 might be
            utilised by Pirelli for a blind tyre test of the company’s 2021
            prototype compounds. This means the laps set using the hard and
            medium tyres in FP1 session might echo the running simulation for
            the race day. One this is sure that the relatively new resurfaced
            race track together with the chances of rain will spice up the 2020
            Portuguese Grand Prix on Sunday.
