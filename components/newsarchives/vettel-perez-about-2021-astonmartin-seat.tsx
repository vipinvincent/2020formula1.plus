            What Vettel and Perez think about 2021 Aston Martin F1 seat???
          </H1>

            Sources indicated that the Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel is
            considering a deal to join the Aston Martin Formula 1 team for the
            2021 season. Vettel has no competitive seats available for 2021
            season and looking for options to stay on the grid next season.

            Earlier Mercedes retained Valtteri Bottas as a first priority to
            partner Lewis Hamilton , Red Bull represented the only leading
            option for Vettel. But Red Bull Formula 1 boss Christian Horner has
            ruled out Sebastian Vettel returning to the team, saying it is a
            “definite no” and Vettel is “aware of that”. With McLaren and
            Renault also already confirming their lineups for 2021, the only
            option left for him, is Racing Point, soon to become Aston Martin
            F1.

            As indicated by the german media a deal has been agreed upon by the
            Racing Point F1, courtesy of team owner Lawrence Stroll. The
            four-times world champion is understood to have been offered a
            contract by Lawrence Stroll, who is planning to build the strongest
            possible team for the rebranding of the team to Aston Martin.

            Assuming the report is accurate, it will be intresting to see how
            the team will make room for Vettel as Racing point already has
            imperative drivers like Sergio Perez, who brings substantial
            sponsorship money to the team and Stroll’s son Lance Stroll, both
            under contract until 2022.

            Meanwhile Perez revealed that he has been contacted from a rival
            team amid Vettel to Racing Point rumours. For the time being Perez
            is under contract with Racing Point until the end of 2022. “I think
            I'm with the team as far as I know,” said Perez. “I have a contract.
            I think the answer to these questions, you will learn them in time.
            We will see what happens in the next weeks. "I know that during the
            week there were obviously the rumours that came out and we actually
            got contacted by a team in the paddock. “I think it's just part of
            the game,” he added “The team has taken a big step forward so it's
            good to have big names related to the team because that means that
            we're making a good job, we're making progress and I think the team
            should be proud of it. And the rest? In Formula 1 you never know.
            Until you start the race, you don’t know if you are racing. This is
            how things are. I've been in Formula 1 10 years so I'm used to this
            stuff.”
