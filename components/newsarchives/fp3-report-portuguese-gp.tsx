            Bottas leads the final practice at Portimao and made it a hat-trick
            of fastest laps in Portuguese GP practice weekend. His Mercedes team
            mate Lewis Hamilton finished second just ahead of Red Bull's Max
            Verstappen in third place. Although track limits have been revised
            after Friday's running, numerous lap times got deleted at Turns 1 at
            4 including max and his teammate Albon, which might have changed the
            top 3 list. AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly impressed with P4 performance
            from his fire engulfed car in FP2 which is just a tenth off former
            team mate Verstappen as he was sandwiched between the Red Bulls on
            the leader board. Alex Albon also had a good session for Red Bull
            with fifth place, which was only 0.3s off his team mate. Meanwhile
            the session ended one minute early after a drain cover got uplifted
            by Vettel who ran over the drain cover at Turn 14, which brought out
            the red flags. This raised the eyebrows of the stewards regarding
            the safety of the track and will be inspected after the practice
            session.he stewards regarding the safety of the track and will be

            Ferrari continues to impress the Portugal GP as Charles Leclerc
            finished sixth reflecting the positive signs from the upgraded
            Ferrari SF1000. But team mate Sebastian Vettel only could manage
            11th but shows signs of improvement. McLaren's Carlos Sainz finishe
            din P7, who took a new engine, turbo and MGU-H. Sergio Perez took P8
            for Racing Point, as the second McLaren of Lando Norris crossed the

            Kimi Raikkonen in P13. Renault's Daniel Ricciardo's only could
            manage P14 as his R.S.20 suffered a DRS failure towards the meid of
            seesion. But later Ricciardo emerged from pit lane for one final go
            in FP3 but that red flag towards the end of session aborted his lap.
