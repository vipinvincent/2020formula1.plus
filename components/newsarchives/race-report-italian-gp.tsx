            Pierre Gasly for Alpha Tauri takes his maiden win in “Sprint Race”
            like Italian GP with Sainz in second and Stroll in third

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly claim his maiden Formula 1 victory at an
            eventful 2020 Italian Grand Prix. In one of the most remarkable F1
            races ever had, McLaren’s Carlos Sainz finished second, with Racing
            Point’s Lance Stroll completing the podium. The eventful scenes of
            Italian Grand Prix started by a Safety Car brought out as Kevin
            Magnussen retired his car just outside the pit lane. Meanwhile Lewis
            Hamilton and Antonio Giovinazzi dived into the pit lane when it was
            closed, whereas rest of the drivers stayed in the race. Later
            Hamilton and Giovinazzi was handed stop and go penalty. This helped
            Gasly at the head of the field, as he had pitted just before the
            Safety Car was brought out. But on Lap 24, Charles Leclerc had a
            huge crashed at the Parabolica, which brought 25-minute red flag
            period. Leclerc was able to climb from his car for every one’s
            relief. But when the race got underway with a second start, the
            Frenchman hold his place brilliantly to take a sensational maiden
            win in Formula 1 at AlphaTauri’s home race.

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Lando Norris finished a brilliant fourth for McLaren, holding off
            the leading Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas in P5, The Finn had a poor
            start that left him sixth at the end of Lap 1. Ricciardo for Renault
            took sixth ahead of Hamilton, who recovered well from his penalty to
            take P7 from the last spot. The Second Renault of Esteban Ocon
            crossed eight,as the second AlphaTauri of Daniil Kvyat in P9 and the
            Racing Point of Sergio Perez rounding out the top 10. Nicholas
            Latifi finished just outside the points in P11. There were high
            emotions in the Williams garage ahead of the Italian Grand Prix, as
            outgoing Deputy Team Principal Claire Williams, on her family’s
            final race with their historic team waves out Nicholas Latifi into
            the pit lane before the race.

            Romain Grosjean for Haas finished 12th ahead of Alfa Romeo’s Kimi
            Räikkönen, who was at P4 during restart after the red flag, while
            having been P3, Raikkonen fell as far as 13th by the end of the
            race. George Russell in second Williams finished P14. Alexander
            Albon was the sole RedBull finisher, only could manage P15 as he was
            handed a five-second race penalty for squeezing Romain Grosjean’s
            Haas into Turn 1. The second Alfa Romeo of Antonio Giovinazzi
            rounded off the finishers list in P16. As both Ferraris had to
            retire from their home race, RedBull’s Max Verstappen also forced to
            retire on Lap 31, as the team spotted an issue on the PU. So, the
            2020 Italian GP has become the first race in the turbo-hybrid era
            that a Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari hasn’t finished on the podium.
