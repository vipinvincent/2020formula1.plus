            Valtteri Bottas continues his top form in Friday with fifth
            consecutive top position in FP1 session at Mugello for Mercedes. In
            the first ever FP1 session at Mugello Red Bull’s Max Verstappen
            finished second and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in third, as Scuderia
            Ferrari celebrates their 1000th World Championship race in this
            weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix. All the top drivers set their fast time
            on soft tyres and it was Bottas who was the first person to cut the
            1m 17m barrier, set his fastest time of 1m17.879s which was just
            0.048s quicker than Verstappen’s. Meanwhile retro-liveried Ferrari
            of Leclerc, managed to lap faster than Lewis Hamilton who finished
            fourth, managed to take third spot in an encouraging session for the
            Italian team ahead of their anniversary race. Leclerc finished
            0.307s off Bottas’s table-topping time and Hamilton was half a
            second behind his team mate. Last week’s Italian Grand Prix winner
            AlphaTauri ‘s Pierre Gasly took fifth who was 0.797s off the top
            rounded top5 list.

            track, finished in 11th who was in third position for a brief
            moment, fastest of all the Ferrari-powered cars. Romain Grosjean for
            Haas finished in 12th and Sebastian Vettel of the second Ferrari
            crossed the line in 13th with more than 1.3s slower than his team
