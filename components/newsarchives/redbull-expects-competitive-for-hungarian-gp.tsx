          <H1>Red Bull expects to be more competitive at Hungarian GP</H1>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Red Bull believes the Hungarian Grand Prix to be more intense.They
            believe that the car will be better suited for Hungarian Grand Prix
            as Hungaroring has greater emphasis on cornering speed which should
            make Red Bull more competitive.

            Red Bull's team boss Christian Horner indicated that
            "Their(Mercedes') straight line speed is impressive," said Horner.
            "There is not much there in cornering speed. "There are some corners
            we are better, some where we are not quite as good. But certainly on
            this track their straight line speed has been very impressive so
            they've made a good step over the winter." “I hope that we’ll be
            more competitive in Hungary, it’s a different type of venue,” he
            said. “Mercedes are very strong and just the distance that the three
            guys [Hamilton, Bottas and Max Verstappen] were ahead of the rest
            was enormous today. Max did well to keep up as well as he did.”

            Meanwhile, Red Bull says it is mystifying to see the pace drop off
            for Alex Albon’s car in longer stints, after his disappointing
            Styrian Grand Prix. Although he finished fourth, 44 seconds behind
            race winner Hamilton, the pace is no match with Max Verstappen. Just
            few days ago, Albon had a chance of winning the season opener in
            Austria before a collision with Lewis Hamilton, the Thai driver find
            it difficult to match the pace of the cars ahead of him.

            Red Bull believes that the cooler conditions on Sunday helped the
            cooling concerns the German car manufacturer in Austria. Indicating
            on the fact that Mercedes triumphed at a circuit where it has
            struggled in recent years, Horner said: “Mercedes have
            underperformed in recent years. They struggled in the heat, they
            struggled in the heat here on Friday. It’s been very cool and
            they’ve performed well here. They were the best team today and we’re
            going to be working even harder to try and catch them.”

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Chief engineer Paul Monaghan said: "Hungary is a different sort of
            circuit isn't it? It's got a trivial straight, and lots of twisty
            bits. The speed of the corners is lower than this place. They're all
            the same speed. So I think, typically, Hungary is usually less
            afflicted by variable weather compared with being in the Alps."
