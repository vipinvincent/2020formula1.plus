            Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas leads FP3 and cleaned all the practice
            sessions at the Tuscan Grand Prix in the top position. Bottas set
            the fastest lap of 1:16.530 which is just +0.017s from Red Bull’s
            Max Verstappen and +0.083s from his team mate Lewis Hamilton in
            third. Racing Point's Lance Stroll finished an impressive P4 after
            last week podium performance. He was 0.582s off the leader and
            nearly one-tenth ahead of Italian Grand Prix winner Pierre Gasly in
            his AlphaTauri. Racing Point's second car finished sixth without the
            bargeboards updates as his team mate Stroll has got the new parts
            for this weekend. Charles Leclerc, within a second off Bottas pace
            finished P7 for Ferrari ahead of their landmark 1000th GP.

            Red Bull’s Alex Albon finished P8, only to get improve his time
            after the chequered flag had flown which is over a second off from
            the top spot. AlphaTauri's Daniil Kvyat took P9 as Romain Grosjean
            rounded off the top 10 for Haas ahead of the Renault of Esteban Ocon
            in 11th . McLaren's Carlos Sainz took 12th and Alfa Romeo’s Antonio
            Giovinazzi finished P13. Kimi Räikkönen could not keep his peak
            performance from the first two practice sessions, only could manage
            P14.

            Kevin Magnussen crossed the line at P15 in the second Hass ahead of
            the Williams of Nicholas Latifi who had a better session than his
            teammate. The Renault of Daniel Ricciardo finished inP17 as the
            Renault cars spent most of the session on mediums. Sebastian Vettel
            disappoints again in his Ferrari with P18, which is apparently the
            worst place by a Ferrari powered car in the session. Lando Norris
            only could manage P19 in his McLaren with Williams' George Russell
            finished last with a brake-by-wire issue keeping him in the garage
            after a one out lap.

            That marks the end of practice sessions for the inaugural Tuscan
            Grand Prix at Mugello. As we heads for the qualifying, the only
            question remains is can Bottas convert the form from practice
            sessions into pole, or will Hamilton find some speed to nail his
            95th pole?
