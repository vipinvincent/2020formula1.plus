            Under cloudy skies over hot Silverstone, Lewis Hamilton set the
            fastest lap of the second free practice session for the 70th
            Anniversary Grand Prix, ahead of his team mate Valtteri Bottas who
            was fastest in FP1. Hamilton was 0.176s quicker than the Finn, with
            Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo finished an impressive third with 0.815s
            off Hamilton’s time.

            Meanwhile Red Bull’s Max Verstappen only managed fourth while his
            team mate Alex Albon finished 11th behind Renault’s Esteban Ocon.
            Renault were the only team to run the hard tyre for long periods on
            Friday afternoon as others focused on long runs using medium and
            soft tyres. Both Racing points finished in top 5 with Lance Stroll
            ahead of Nico Hulkenberg.

            Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc managed 32 laps to go seventh-fastest with
            both McLaren drivers Lando Norris sand Carlos Sainz finished in P8
            and P9 with Norris just a tenth faster than Sainz. Clarles’ team
            mate Vettel's stoppage was the notable incident from the session as
            he pulled over at Turn 9, his SF1000 leaking oil on the track
            surface, which triggered a Virtual Safety Car, later red flagging
            the session. Before his issue, he had only managed the 14th

            Romain Grosjean of Hass finished 15 while his team mate Kevin
            Magnussen only could manage 18th. Williams’ George Russell was again
            quicker than his team mate Nicholas Latifi and both Alfa Romeos,
            ending the day 16th quickest ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in 17th .
            Latifi only could manage 19th place with Antonio Giovinazzi in the
            last place after taking the wheel from Kubica who drove in FP1.
            Antonio Giovinazzi’s car stopped on the run off at the
            Maggotts-Becketts complex in the last few minutes of the session
            with what appeared to be an engine issue, which brought out the red
            flags to end the day's running.
