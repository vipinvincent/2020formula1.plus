              What are Qualifying engine modes or "Party Modes" ?{' '}
            </strong>
            Qualifying modes or the “part modes” is essentially tuning up of
            engine with extra engine revs and using the hybrid system
            differently so as to improve the ability to run without harvesting
            power and diverting it to the battery, thereby allowing maximum
            deployment of energy recovered via the two energy recovery systems.
            Sometimes the party modes use aggressive ignition timing and fuel
            mixture, there by pushing the power unit to its absolute best yield.
            A homogeneous system is also used for overtaking during the racing.
            Previously the qualifying and overtake modes would have a time limit
            per event imposed upon them by the engine manufacturer, so as to
            keep the power unit within its usage limit.

              What are the proposed Qualifying engine modes changes?{' '}
            </strong>
            A letter sent to the teams at Barcelona and were informed that
            Technical Directive wants to have only one mode in use for both
            qualifying and the race with the details to be confirmed by a
            technical directive that will be issued before the Belgian GP at the
            end of August. To assist policing, the FIA has to regulate a number
            of power unit parameters through very detailed data analysis which
            will help officials monitor what teams are doing with their power
            units. Noting the “multitude and complexity of modes being used, it
            is extremely difficult for the FIA to monitor compliance with all
            the PU-related regulations and provisions in selected critical
            moments of the event.” The letter also cited Article 27.1 of the
            sporting regulations, which references drivers being required to
            drive the car alone and unaided, and specified that “the changes to
            ICE modes that are currently in force could potentially mean that
            the driver does not drive the car alone and unaided.”

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            <strong> What are the expected outcomes? </strong>
            The clampdown, which is set to be formalized as a technical
            directive, will blunt the dominant Mercedes’ edge in qualifying
            there by levelling the Formula 1 field by ceasing the huge advantage
            enjoyed during on Saturday afternoon qualifying sessions. This will
            also regulate the teams using the “overtake modes” used during
            racing for easy and seamless overtaking. The same is used by Lando
            Norris during Austrian GP, towards the end of the race for
            overtaking and accomplish the fastest lap. The new regulations,
            however is set to stop all these scenarios.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            <strong> Will it benefit any teams? </strong>
            Yes. The new regulation would save expensive development programs
            for Honda, Renault and Ferrari at a time when the FIA is very
            actively trying to close down cost drivers. The party mode ban is
            supposed to shrinks that gap of Mercedes with other teams during the
            qualification and there by balancing the rest of the grid, which
            will diminish any chances supremacy. Moreover, the new regulation
            will improve the engine lifespan and reliability of the power unit,
            which will inherit extra cost benefits.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            <strong> Will it really benefit the F1 and fans? </strong>
            No. The ban of qualifying mode is primarily focused to tame
            Mercedes’ massive advantage during the qualifying, but this will
            ultimately work in favor of Mercedes’ advantage in the race, as the
            other teams will not have the special modes during racing . On the
            contrary, the banning of the special modes means, other teams will
            not have any access to the “overtake modes” used during the race for
            easy overtakes and the strategy calls for under cuts and over cuts.
            This will result in more boring races with car trains all over the
            race tracks and the driver in back needs to rely only on the
            mistakes by the driver in front for overtakes. Even though the
            intention of ban is to level up the race field, but this will
            neutralize the race and the race will be predicable based on the
            qualification or start grid.

              What do the drivers and teams think of this new regulations?
            </strong>
            <strong> Lewis Hamilton</strong> commented that it’s “not a
            surprise” that an advantage Mercedes and their customer teams have
            could potentially be quashed. “It’s not a surprise, they’re always
            trying to slow us down,” Hamilton added: “ Just going back to the
            fact, at the end of the day, the guys at our team have done such a
            great job with the engine. “As I told you, it’s obviously to slow us
            down, but I don’t think it’s going to get the result that they want.
            So, it’s totally fine if they do it,” he said. Team mate{' '}
            <strong>Valtteri Bottas </strong>
            added, “If that’s the regulation that comes it’s the same for
            everyone. It’s not up to us but we’ll take it if it comes.”
            <br />
            <strong> Max Verstappen</strong> commented “Maybe it’s good because
            we are not really allowed to touch the car after qualifying except…
            engine modes, so probably if you want to go down that route then I
            think it’s good that you maybe get rid of as well,”
            <br />
            “For us we don’t have anything different from quali to the race, so
            for us it won’t change anything,” said{' '}
            <strong>Charles Leclerc</strong>. <strong>Vettel </strong>
            added, “As Charles said, it doesn’t affect us this season so let’s
            wait and see. It always depends what you are able to pull off, I
            guess. If you have something developed or on your engine that you
            can probably run a certain amount of mileage with more power or more
            stress on the engine then it’s probably not the best news.
            <br />
            <strong>George Russell</strong> said “Yeah, I’d be disappointed to
            see it lost,” he said. “I think for every engine manufacturer you’ve
            got a boost for qualifying when you’re within the car, you’ve got
            the lowest amount of fuel you have for the whole weekend, you’ve got
            the fastest engine mode, you’re the most pumped up and ready you are
            for that lap you’re about to approach. “Everything feels like that
            little bit extra that allows you to extract that little bit more
            from the car and it’s such an exciting part of the weekend.”
            <br />
            Mercedes Formula 1 boss <strong>Toto Wolff</strong> believes the
            upcoming ban on engine modes in qualifying will potentially give the
            team more performance in races. “I think we don’t lack performance
            on Saturdays. We had until now quite a margin. We struggled in some
            of the races where we were quite limited in powerful engine modes,
            and if F1 were to ban in-season certain power unit modes, then I
            think it will actually help us in the race.
            <br />
            Red Bull's <strong>Christian Horner</strong> suggests all teams will
            be affected by the engine mode ban, but believes the FIA's
            initiative is "a healthy thing" for the manufacturers."It will
            affect all teams, the question is how much," Horner said on Friday.
            "I think that these qualifying modes have been pushed and developed
            over the years.
            <br />
            Ferrari Team boss <strong>Mattia Binotto</strong> says that, “It’s
            not the last Directive, certainly, it’s even not the first technical
            directive on power units, showing how complex and difficult is that
            set of regulations.”.
