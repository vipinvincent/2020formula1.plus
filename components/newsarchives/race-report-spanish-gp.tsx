            Hamilton dominates and wins his fifth Spanish GP win with Verstappen
            in P2 splitting Mercedes

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton, after leading every lap from pole to
            finish completed his fifth Spanish Grand Prix win, and his fourth
            victory of the 2020 season with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen coming
            home ahead of the sister Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas. After having a
            good start, Hamilton stormed in to first turn and never looked back
            executed a near perfect race even calling the (best) strategy to put
            mediums while his engineers opted for red softs. Verstappen also had
            a great start, jumped to second at the getaway, but could not
            challenge Hamilton as he finished 24s adrift. But Bottas had a poor
            start dropping him from P2 to P4 off the line, before eventually
            recovering to third in the beginning of the race without causing any
            issues. But a wrong strategy of using a set of used softs couldn’t
            help him catch Verstappen as he was pushed into traffic after the
            first pit stop. Eventually Bottas finished +44.752s behind his
            teammate.

            Racing Point’s Sergio Perez crossed the line in fourth but forced to
            as a five-second penalty for ignoring blue flags, promoting Lance
            Stroll P4. Perez eventually slotted into fifth, ahead of the McLaren
            of Carlos Sainz who maintained his 100% record of finishing in the
            points at his home race. This time Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel was
            in the points, as his late call on the one-stop strategy helped him
            to cross the line in seventh. The second Red Bull of Alexander Albon
            only managed eight as his strategy of pitting early for hards never
            paid off and more over spoiled his chances as he was pushed into the
            traffic after the first pitstop, raising eye brows again for a bad
            strategy call. Pierre Gasly of AlphaTauri had a good race with some
            impressive moves in the mid field finished in ninth spot ahead of
            second McLaren of Lando Norris, this time no last lap magic rounded
            top 10 list.

            Unfortunately, the two Renault drivers disappoints as they failed to
            materialize the expected strong race pace on race day as Daniel
            Ricciardo finished 11th with Esteban Ocon 13th. The alternate
            strategy of one pit stop also not helped the yellow and black cars
            as the both cars couldn’t finish in points. The second AlphaTauri of
            Daniil Kvyat, after a five-second penalty for ignoring blue flags,
            as like Sergio, splits the two Renaults and finished 12th outside
            the points. Kimi Räikkönen finished in 14th the same spot he started
            the race from. In between Kimi Raikkonen breaks record for most
            miles driven in sport’s history after completing lap 37 of the
            Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday. The Finn has raced over 50,000 miles –
            more than twice the circumference of the Earth.

            Kevin Magnussen of Haas finished fifteenth ahead of the second Alfa
            Romeo of Giovinazzi who finished in 16th. The two Williams of George
            Russell and Nicholas Latifi finished P17 and P18. The second Haas of
            Grosjean Romain Grosjean was classified 19th and last after a
            half-spin at Turn 8 on the penultimate lap. Also, he might have some
            explaining to do in the next Grand Prix Drivers’ Association
            meeting, after he once again executed a late defensive move on
            Raikkonen. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, the only driver to retire from
            the race, after suffering an electrical issue at the halfway point
            that pitched him into a spin at Turn 15, before eventually retiring
            his SF1000.
