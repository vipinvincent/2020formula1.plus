          <H1>Ferrari restructures Formula 1 technical department</H1>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Ferrari announced a restructuring of their Formula One technical
            department on Wednesday after struggling in the first three races of
            the 2020 season. Ferrari is planning to set up a new performance
            development department that will be the bedrock of its car
            development, which will address the poor Formula 1 form of SF1000
            and team.

            Binotto will remain as Team Principal, with Enrico Gualtieri in
            charge of the Power Unit department, Laurent Mekies as Sporting
            Director also in charge of trackside activities and Simone Resta
            continues as the Chassis Engineering department. The inception of
            the Performance Department which will be overseen by Enrico Cardile
            featuring input from Rory Byrne who played a significant role at
            Ferrari as Chief Designer in the early 2000s who is one of the key
            architects of the Michael Schumacher era of Ferrari dominance .
            Earlier in 2016, Enrico Cardile has moved from Ferrari’s GT
            department, and now holds the role of Head of Aerodynamics and
            Vehicle Project Manager.

            The changes was induced after Ferrari started this season with more
            than a second a lap slower than that of the world champions and
            front runners Mercedes. The idea is to create a more vertical
            organisation and clearly assign responsibility. Ferrari said in a
            statement they were "instituting a chain of command that is more
            focused and simplified and provides the heads of each department the
            necessary powers to achieve their objectives".

          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            As per Binotto, “As hinted at a few days ago, we are making changes
            to the technical side of the organisation so as to speed up the
            design and development on the car performance front,” “A change of
            direction was needed to define clear lines of responsibility and
            working processes, while reaffirming the company’s faith in its
            technical talent pool. "The department run by Enrico Cardile will be
            able to count on the experience of Rory Byrne and established
            engineers such as David Sanchez. It will be the cornerstone of the
            car’s development. “We believe Ferrari personnel are of the highest
            level and we have nothing to envy about our main competitors in this
            respect, but we had to make a decisive change, raising the bar in
            terms of the responsibilities of the department heads.” “We have
            started to lay the foundations of a process which should lead to a
            new and enduring winning cycle,” he added.

            Binotto added "It will take some time and we will suffer setbacks
            like the one we are experiencing right now in terms of results and
            performance. However, we must react to these shortcomings with
            strength and determination to get back to being at the very top of
            this sport as soon as possible. This is what we all want and what
            our fans all over the world expect of us."
