            Max Verstappen has become the first non-Mercedes driver to win a
            race in 2020 F1 season aided with incredible driving and a brilliant
            strategy by the team. The interesting choice of tyres made by the F1
            for the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix produced an action-packed racing
            throughout the grid, encouraging teams to try out wide variety of
            strategies. Verstappen being the only driver in the top 10 to begin
            the race on the hard tyres. quickly passed the Racing Point of Nico
            Hulkenberg in P3 and he managed his pace brilliantly throughout the
            race, pressuring the Mercedes and forcing them to take alternative
            strategies secures his first victory since Brazil last year and Red
            Bull’s first win at Silverstone since 2012.

            Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes accomplished a late-race surge on his
            team mate Valtteri Bottas with two laps to go into Brooklands to
            claim second place there by equaling the number of podiums finishes
            by Michael Schumacher. Meanwhile Bottas, probably the biggest looser
            of race, second time in three years that has failed to convert a
            Silverstone pole into a win, as he has to settle with third only
            after a questionable strategy performed by Mercedes team backing
            Hamilton to perform better in the last stint of the race.

            Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc with a one-stop work to claimed P4, while
            his team mate Sebastian Vettel could only manage P12, due to an
            early spin at the first corner of the race. Alex Albon took an
            impressive fifth in the second Red Bull, passing the Racing Point of
            Lance Stroll with a lap to go. Both Racing point drivers could not
            keep up the qualifying performances in the race as Stroll finished
            P6 ahead of stand-in team mate Nico Hulkenberg, who stopped very
            late on for soft tyres, later clarified that the Nico has reported a
            significant vibration towards the end of the race. Renault’s Esteban
            Ocon finished P8, ahead of the McLaren of Lando Norris in P9 and the
            AlphaTauri of Daniil Kvyat in P10, despite of his lower starting
            position, finished ahead of his team mate Pierre Gasly.
