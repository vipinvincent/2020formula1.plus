            Merecedes’ Lewis Hamilton heads the timing chart in the only
            practice session of Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as F1 returns to Imola
            for the first time since 2006. Since it is a two day race weekend at
            Imola, with no Friday practices, the teams and drivers had only 90
            minute session before qualifying to get to know about the Autodromo
            Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari (Imola) Circuit. Red Bull's Max
            Verstappen became the second quickest driver after leading the
            session for the early part on medium and hard componds. Valtteri
            Bottas in the second Mercedes crossed the line third. Pierre Gasly
            finished an impressive fourth towards the end of the session ahead
            of Charles Leclerc in Ferrari.

            Renault duo Daniel Ricciardo and Esteban Ocon finished in P6 and P7
            respectively with Gasly’s team mate Daniil Kvyat in a strong eight
            who never has qualified inn top ten in this season. Alex Albon
            disappoints again in the second Red Bull only could manage P9 which
            was, 1.335s off Hamilton's pace. Lance Stroll and Sergio Perez in
            Racing Point follows in tenth and eleventh. The struggling Ferrari
            of Sebastian Vettel managed 12th, which was over a second slower
            than his teammate Charles. Romain Grosjean for Haas finished 13th
            ahead of McLaren's Carlos Sainz.

            Antonio Giovinazzi, who earlier in the weekend got confirmed by Alfa
            Romeo crossed the line in 14h ahead of Lando Norris in the second
            McLaren, as his fastest lap on the softs got deleted for
            overstepping track limits toward the end of the session. Last week’s
            firt lap hero, Kimi Räikkönen, who also got retained by Alfa Romeo
            for 2020 season finished P17. George Russell in Williams finished
            18th as his team mate Nicholas Latifi spend much time in pits with a
            brake-by-wire failure with around an hour remaining, but emerged
            again to take for 20th overall. Haas's Kevin Magnussen crossed the
            line P19. So after the one and only practice session of Emilia
            Romagna Grand Prix completed, teams and drivers will have enough
            information for the Qualifying which is scheduled for the evening.
