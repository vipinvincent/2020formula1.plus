            Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas leads the multiple red flag disrupted
            second practice session on the Friday of the Portuguese Grand Prix.
            The session got suspended twice after Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri
            caught fire, and an spectacular crash of Max Verstappen and Lance
            Stroll in Turn 1. But Max Verstappen managed P2 for Red Bull as
            McLaren’s Lando Norris slotted into P3 towards the end of the
            session. Both Bottas and Norris was on set of red Softs for their
            respective fastest laps, while Max set his fastest lap on the medium
            tyre. Charles Leclerc once again impressed with P4 with the latest
            updates to the SF1000 proves to be in the right direction for
            Ferrari. Carlos Sainz finished in P5 near the end of the session in
            the second McLaren, with 1.173s off Bottas’ pace, as Sebastian
            Vettel finished encouraging sixth, which is around three-tenths off
            Leclerc’s pace.

            Gasly finished managed P7 before his car was on fire bringing the
            red flag halfway through the hour and a half session. Galsly pulled
            up his AlphaTauri AT01 on the side of the track at the exit of Turn
            13 only to start splitting flames with the marshals eventually
            putting the blaze out after it had been burning for around a minute.
            The reigning champion Lewis Hamilton, who didn’t appear to be happy
            with his W11 only manage P8 which is 1.368s adrift of his team mate.
            Top 10 were rounded out by Renault’s Esteban Ocon and the second Red
            Bull of Alex Albon, as they had their multiple laps got deleted for
            track limit infringements at Turn 4. George Russell was P11 ahead of
            the Racing Point of Sergio Perez in P12. Daniel Ricciardo was
            hampered on his penultimate attempt at a flying lap by a Williams
            exiting the pits, only managed P13.

            Nicholas Latifi in second Williams finised in P14 as Alfa Romeo’s
            Kimi Raikkonen crossed the line in P15. Kevin Magnussen finished in
            16th with AlphaTauri’s Daniil Kvyat finished in 17th after a spin
            earlier in the session. Romain Grosjean managed P18 as Stroll only
            could finish in P19. It was indeed a dramatic moment, with 29
            minutes left to go as drivers keen to get their qualifying
            simulation laps in, Verstappen and Stroll, on a flying lap, dragged
            down the main straight as the pair collided at Turn 1, with Stroll
            appearing not to register Verstappen’s presence on the inside of the
            corner. The stewards set to investigate the incident which brought
            the second red flag of the session. Antonio Giovinazzi rounded of
            the list in P20.
