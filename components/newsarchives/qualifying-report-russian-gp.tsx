            Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton claimed his 96th pole position, as he was
            within a matter of seconds of being knocked out of Q2 in a dramatic
            qualifying session at Sochi. Hamilton was in the verge of getting
            knocked out in Q2 as his first time got deleted for a track limits
            infringement leaving him in the drop zone when Vettel crashed at
            Turn 4 with just over two minutes left of the session, bringing out
            the red flags. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen finished second with 0.563s
            from the leader as Valtteri Bottas had to settle for P3. Sergio
            Perez running in an update-less Racing Point RP20 finished an
            excellent fourth behind the top three. Reanult’s Daniel Ricciardo
            could not replicate his practice form and had to settle for fifth,
            the highest the Australian will ever have started in Sochi. Carlos
            Sainz’s McLaren finished in P6 which was 1,246s off Hamilton’s pace
            ahead of the second Renault of Esteban Ocon.

            the pace will have start in the mid field at Sochi where the
            overtaking opportunities will be less. Ferrai’s Charles Leclerc only
            managed a frustrating P11 as his run was interrupted by Vettel’s
            crash and subsequent red flags. The home racer, Daniil Kvyat will
            start in P12 as the second racing point of Lance Stroll was unable
            to go for a last run due to a mechanical issue saw him drop out in

            crash in Q2 while he was setting his pace, from which the German

            of the race day.
