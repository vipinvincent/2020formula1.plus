            Hamilton set the lap record in Qualifying leads Bottas and

            Lewis Hamilton continued his form set the fastest time in Qualifying
            of the Belgian Grand Prix with his Mercedes team mate Bottas in P3
            and RedBull’s Max Verstappen in P3. All the drivers set their
            fastest laps in soft compound. Hamilton ended up 0.5s clear of team
            mate Valtteri Bottas, to secure his sixth pole at Spa and fifth of
            the season. Bottas only managed second to give Mercedes their first
            front row lock out in Belgium since 2015, finishing just 0.015s
            adrift in third. Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo carried his impressive
            Friday pace through to qualifying as he ended up a brilliant fourth
            fastest, his best-ever qualifying at Spa ahead of Red Bull’s Alex
            Albon who continued his improved form with his most accomplished
            qualifying performance of the year.

            Esteban Ocon finished in six for the first time since Monza last
            year, while Carlos Sainz starts seventh, his best Spa qualifying,
            beating the two Racing Points. Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll finised
            in eighth and ninth respectively. McLaren’s Lando Norris completed
            the top 10. Alphatauri’s Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly slotted in
            11th and 12 respectively with Kvyat out performing Gasly for the
            first time in 2020.

            Ferrari disappoints in qualifying, lacking their pace in all three
            sectors couldn’t manage to slot into Q3. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc
            and Sebastian Vettel finished in 13th and 14th respectively with the
            red cars 1.048s slower than the dominant pace at Spa last year. This
            was the first time since Silverstone 2014 that a red car took no
            part in Q3. George Russell of Williams could manage Q2 but only
            managed 15th place in the end. Alfa Romeo’s Kimi and Giovinazzi in
            finished in 16th and 18th with Grosjean of Haas splitting the two
            Alfa Romeos. The second Williams of Latifi managed 19th with the
            second Haas of Kevin Magnussen finished in the last spot.
