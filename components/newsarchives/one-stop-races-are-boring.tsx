          <H1>"One-stop races are making F1 boring" - Christian Horner</H1>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Red Bull boss Christian Horner has joined Lewis Hamilton in
            revealing one-stop races could be a reason why Formula 1 is becoming
            boring. Formula 1 needs to move away from one-stop races if it is to
            avoid boring spectacles like 2020 Belgian Grand Prix. The early
            safety car period turned 2020 Belgian GP in to a tyre management
            phenomenon once drivers were forced to switch to the hard compound.
            Eventually, the Belgian GP followed the Spanish GP became another
            dull display dominated by Hamilton, who led from start to finish
            each time. Race winner Lewis Hamilton and podium finisher Max
            Verstappen later said that they had a "pretty boring" owing to tyre
            management for the cockpit, as they had to focus more on keeping
            their tyres alive rather than real racing.

            Horner thinks that races where the one-stop is the fastest strategy
            inevitably lead to situations where drivers go into tyre
            conservation mode which is not good for entertainment. Red Bull team
            principal Horner has also weighed in on the matter after his driver
            Max Verstappen, who finished third at Spa, described the race as
            “boring” and “not enjoyable”. "I think one stop races are always
            boring," said Horner. "I think that you need to have two to
            three-stop races. I think that mixes the order up, it mixes the
            strategy up. “I think we’ve always seen that one-stop races, where
            drivers are driving under the tyre, trying to conserve the tyre,
            it’s very tough. “I think you need some more variability of strategy
            in order to create offsets between the cars, and that the most
            fundamental thing we need to do is to increase the amount of
            strategies that you can go into a race with. “Pretty much everyone
            elected to take a one-stop strategy in Belgium and that’s never
            going to produce an exciting grand prix.” Horner said.

            Quoting if the best way to achieve what he wanted was with Pirelli
            being more aggressive with its tyre compound choices, Horner said:
            "In an ideal world. I think the most fundamental thing that we need
            to do is to increase the amount of strategies that you can go into a
            race with. F1 race director Michael Masi is also not as convinced
            one-stops are necessarily the cause of the problem though. "I think
            it's probably a bit harsh connecting one-stop races and boring
            races, because I think we've seen some exciting one-stop races," he
            said. "We've also seen some boring two-stop races and some exciting
            two-stop races. So I think from that perspective, that is not a
            notion I would support. "But having said that, the FIA together with
            Pirelli, F1, the teams and obviously the input of the drivers work
            together to try and fulfil a number of criteria each year, and it's
            no secret that Pirelli have been working closely with all of those
            parties.
