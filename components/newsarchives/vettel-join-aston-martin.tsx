            Vettel to join rebranded Aston Martin team in 2021 as Perez
            announces Racing Point F1 exit

            Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel will remain in Formula 1
            and confirmed his switch to Racing Point, rebranded as Aston Martin
            Racing Formula 1 team for the 2021 season. This move has been
            suspected for a while, but it’s now been confirmed by Racing Point
            that Sebastian Vettel will join them for next season.“I am pleased
            to finally share this exciting news about my future.” said Vettel as
            he looks to the future with a new team after six years with Ferrari.
            He’ll team up with Lance Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence Stroll,
            for the team’s rebrand to Aston Martin after Stroll’s purchase of
            the British car manufacturer. Meanwhile, the tenure of Vettel’s
            contract has not yet been revealed.

            Earlier on Wednesday evening, Sergio Perez has revealed that he will
            be moving out of Racing Point, formerly Force India at the end of
            this season. In the statement he said: "Everything in life always
            has a beginning and an end, and after seven years together, my time
            with the team will come to an end after this season. The Mexican
            driver said the 2020 season would be his last with racing Point team
            despite the fact that he signed a three-year contract just last
            year. He also added that he has no "Plan B" in terms of a drive for
            2021, and "It hurts a bit as I bet on the team during very rough
            times; we managed to overcome obstacles and I am very proud of
            saving the jobs of several of my team mates."
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            Moreover, Lance Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence, likely to be in
            the team, it was anyone’s guess that Vettel did join, Perez could be
            the one who has to make the way. Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer said
            “Everybody at Silverstone is hugely excited by this news. Sebastian
            is a proven champion and brings a winning mentality that matches our
            own ambitions for the future as Aston Martin F1 Team. "On a Saturday
            or Sunday afternoon, Sebastian is one of the best in the world, and
            I can’t think of a better driver to help take us into this new era.
            He will play a significant role in taking this team to the next
            level.”
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 mb-2 text-base leading-normal text-gray-700'>
            {' '}
            But the real question is “has Racing Point/Aston Martin really done
            the right thing in ditching Perez for 2021, as Vettel continues to
            struggle in 2020 season?” Vettel is currently 13th in the drivers’
            championship, with just 16 points and a best finish of sixth in
            eight races this year as he has struggled for pace in what has been
            an uncompetitive Ferrari. Meanwhile Sergio Perez is in eleventh
            position with more than double the points of Vettel and two races
            less done. The signing of a four-time world champion is further
            proof that Racing Point means business. It is a definite fact that
            Vettel will bring a wealth of experience and financial aids to the
            new team. But Perez has frequently proven himself to be one of the
            best in F1 in the front end or in the mid field. He has been an
            instrumental figure in making Racing Point from the ashes of Force
            India to what it is today. As such, while Vettel joining what will
            become Racing Point’s huge leap for a team that was originally
            established as Jordan in 1991, it is also a chance for Vettel to
            rebuild his reputation in a new environment.
